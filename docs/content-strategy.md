## Career Narrative

Ali Yildiz is a **13-year data engineering veteran** who evolved from traditional software development and data warehousing into modern cloud-native big data and ML pipeline architecture. His arc: banking software developer → data warehouse specialist → big data engineer → cloud data architect → senior data engineer consulting for major enterprises across Europe (ING, FedEx, Coca Cola, GarantiBBVA, Irish Rail) through Xebia Data.

**Key differentiator:** Ali doesn't just build pipelines — he designs end-to-end data architectures that bridge the gap between business objectives and technical execution. He's worked across all three major clouds (GCP, AWS, Azure), mastered both batch and streaming paradigms, and holds Databricks Professional certification.

**Target audience:** Recruiters, hiring managers, engineering leaders, and potential consulting clients looking for a senior data engineer or cloud data architect.

## Tone & Voice

- **Professional but warm** — approachable, not corporate
- **First person where possible** — "I build..." not "Ali builds..."
- **Technical confidence without jargon overload** — mention tools and frameworks but always tie back to business outcomes
- **Concise** — let the experience speak; don't over-explain

## Visual Direction

- **Dark theme** with a deep purple accent (reflecting the Xebia/CV branding)
- **Clean, minimal layout** — single-page scroll
- **Monospace accents** for technical terms — subtly nod to the engineering craft
- **Generous whitespace** — let the content breathe
- **No stock photos** — use icons, subtle gradients, and data-inspired visual elements

## Site Sections

### 1. Hero

- **Priority:** Hero (top of page)
- **Purpose:** Immediate identity + value proposition
- **Key message:** Senior Data Engineer who builds end-to-end cloud data architectures
- **Content guidance:**
  - Full name and title prominently displayed
  - One strong headline (see below)
  - A short tagline
  - CTA buttons: "View Experience" (scroll) and "Get in Touch" (scroll to contact)
  - Optional: subtle animated data flow or pipeline illustration in background

**Headline options:**
1. "Engineering Data, End to End"
2. "From Source to Insight — I Build the Pipeline"
3. "13 Years of Turning Raw Data Into Business Value"

**Recommended headline:** "Engineering Data, End to End"
**Tagline:** "Senior Data Engineer & Cloud Architect — building scalable pipelines across GCP, AWS, and Azure"

### 2. About

- **Priority:** Primary
- **Purpose:** Human connection — who Ali is beyond the title
- **Key message:** Solution-oriented engineer who thinks in full data flows, not just components
- **Content guidance:**
  - Use the biography text but rewrite in first person
  - Mention the MSc in Data Mining
  - Mention the Xebia Data affiliation
  - Keep it to 3-4 sentences max
  - Tone: confident, forward-looking

### 3. Experience

- **Priority:** Primary (this is the strongest section)
- **Purpose:** Prove depth and breadth with real company names
- **Key message:** Consistent track record of delivering data solutions at major enterprises
- **Content guidance:**
  - Show as a **timeline or card grid** — most recent first
  - For each role: company name, title, date range, 2-3 key bullets, tech stack pills
  - **Highlight these top 4 most heavily:** Irish Rail (most recent, IoT angle), ING (banking, enterprise scale), Coca Cola İçecek (cloud architecture), GarantiBBVA (longest tenure, 6 years)
  - Collapse or summarize older roles (IBTech, BIS Çözüm) — they show the foundation but don't need full detail
  - Each experience card should show the tech stack as colored pills/badges

### 4. Skills

- **Priority:** Primary
- **Purpose:** Quick scannable overview of technical toolkit
- **Key message:** Full-stack data engineer across all three clouds
- **Content guidance:**
  - Grid layout by category: Programming, Data Stack, Cloud, Tech
  - Use icons or logos where possible (Python, AWS, GCP, Azure, Docker, etc.)
  - Keep it visual — pills, badges, or icon grids, not bullet lists
  - Don't list every tool from every job — the curated `skills` data is already right

### 5. Certifications

- **Priority:** Secondary
- **Purpose:** Third-party validation of expertise
- **Key message:** Databricks certified at Professional level
- **Content guidance:**
  - Small section — just the two certifications with dates
  - Can be integrated into Skills section or standalone
  - Use Databricks badge/logo if available

### 6. Education

- **Priority:** Secondary
- **Purpose:** Academic foundation — MSc is noteworthy
- **Key message:** MSc in Data Mining provides analytical depth
- **Content guidance:**
  - Compact display — degree, field, institution, years
  - Lead with MSc (most relevant)
  - The Coimbra exchange shows international experience — worth including
  - Keep minimal — education supports but doesn't lead the narrative

### 7. Contact

- **Priority:** Primary (every visitor needs a clear way to reach out)
- **Purpose:** Convert interest into connection
- **Key message:** Easy to reach, open to opportunities
- **Content guidance:**
  - Email, LinkedIn, GitHub — all clickable
  - Optional: short call-to-action text like "Let's build something together"
  - Clean layout — no forms, just direct links
  - LinkedIn and GitHub should open in new tabs
